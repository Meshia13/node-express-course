    <h1>Murder Mystery in Candyland</h1>
    <div class="story">
        <p>The sugary streets of Candyland were usually peaceful, but tonight, something was terribly wrong. The grand gumdrop clock 
            struck midnight, and a scream echoed through Licorice Lane.
        </p>
        <p>Detective Fudge arrived at the scene—a crime in the heart of Peppermint Plaza. King Caramel was found lifeless, his golden 
           crown resting beside him in a pool of melted chocolate. The suspects? The conniving Lord Licorice, the sweet yet secretive 
           Lady Lollipop, and the ever-mysterious Gumdrop Twins.
        </p>
        <p>As Detective Fudge examined the clues—a half-eaten candy cane, a trail of jellybean footprints—he realized this was no 
            ordinary case. The sweetness of Candyland masked a bitter truth, and he had until sunrise to uncover the culprit before 
            the entire kingdom crumbled.

// This should load writeFileSync and readFileSync functions from the fs module. Then you will use writeFileSync to write 3 lines 
// to a file, ./temporary/fileA.txt, using the "append" flag for each line after the first one. Then use readFileSync to read the 
// file, and log the contents to the console. Be sure you create the file in the temporary directory. That will ensure that it isnâ€™t 
// pushed to Github when you submit your answers (because that file has been added to the .gitignore file for you already which 
// tells git not to look at those files).
